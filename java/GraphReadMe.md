# Graphs 

## Lab 35
- Implement your own Graph. 


### Features
- add node
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph
- add edge
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
- get nodes
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
Empty collection returned if there are no nodes
- get neighbors
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Empty collection returned if there are no nodes
- size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
0 if there are none
## Lab 36

### Features
- breadth first
Arguments: Node
Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
