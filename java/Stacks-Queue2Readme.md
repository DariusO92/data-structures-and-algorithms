# Stack and Queue

## Code challenge 10

- Features
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
Stack
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
push
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
pop
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
Removes the node from the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty queue
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Code challenge 11

- Feature Tasks
Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
Methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
